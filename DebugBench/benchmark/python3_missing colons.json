As such, we can consider this one with not too much of a stretch of the mind. \\n\\nEach integer value in our selected string has a list of indices at which it appears. IF we make a mapping of these list of indices for each value in order of appearance in s, we can use that against the ordering of appearance of list of values in t (we do not necessarily need to make said list of t, but could if we so chose) \\n\\nOnce we have this map, our first bet is to actually get the set of unique items in t, which can be done rather nicely with generators that will do the autoskip inclusions as needed. \\n\\nUsing unique t, our first check is that all of the unique t values are present. If not, then we can skip to returning False. \\n\\nOtherwise, we need to loop over t, and for each character check if it is in our map. If not, also False. \\n\\nIf we then loop over values up to this point (such that if we drew say 5 we\\'d go from 0 to 4 inclusive) we need to find that the value is in indexes and that the indexes at that point has a starting value at least as advanced or more so than the indexes for the drawn values first appearance. If this does not occur, then they are not in ascending order and may also return False. \\n\\nIf all of that passes, we need to discard the current item at the front of indexes at the drawn character. If in doing so we now eliminate that list, we need to eliminate the character drawn from indices entirely (this is why we have that second check for inclusion near the top). \\n\\nIf we manage all of that, there\\'s nothing to stop the transformation and can return True. \\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nUse collections default dict with collections deque for each character valuation in s \\n\\nMake a map of the character values -> list of indices of occurrence in order from first to last \\n\\nMake a set of unique t values \\n\\n- For each unique t value in unique t values \\n    - if that value is not in our mapping \\n        - return False \\n\\nLoop over t (effectively getting the unique indices for each value of t) \\n- as you do, convert your character into its designated key (This is here for other mapping versions of the problem) \\n- if we do not have that designated ky in our map \\n    - return false \\n- otherwise, loop over lesser character designations in range to character designation \\n    - if we have the map at lesser character designation and the map at lesser character designation points to a list whose first index of occurrence is less than the first index of occurrence of our current character designation, it must be that they are not in order, and can return False \\n- after completing lesser character loop, remove the most recent occurrence of indexes at character designation by popping left from the map at the character designation \\n- if the map now points to an empty list for character designation, remove character designation from the map entirely.    \\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity : O(S + T)\\n    - O(S) to build s mapping \\n    - O(T) to build t unique characters \\n    - O(T) to loop over characters in T \\n        - within which we do at most O(5) work to loop in range of lesser characters on average \\n    - Total then is O(S + T + ~5T) -> O(S + C * T) -> O(S + T)  \\n\\n\\n- Space complexity : O(S + t) \\n    - Store O(s) lists of size to account for S, so O(S) \\n    - Store O(t) \\n    - Remove storage for potentially all of O(S) \\n    - Averages out to O(S + t) at worst  \\n\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def isTransformable(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool :\\n        # make a mapping of deque lists called indexes \\n        indexes = collections.defaultdict(collections.deque)\\n        # enumerate s \\n        for index, character in enumerate(s) :\\n            # indexes at the int cast of character has this index added to it  \\n            indexes[int(character)].append(index)\\n\\n        # get unique values in t \\n        unique_t_values = set([int(t_i) for t_i in t])\\n        # for t_v in unique t values \\n        for t_v in unique_t_values : \\n            # if not in indexes \\n            if t_v not in indexes :\\n                # return False as we are missing pieces  \\n                return False \\n        \\n        # loop over t in order given  \\n        for character in t : \\n            # get the characters integer designation \\n            character_designation = int(character)\\n            # update may cause new misses which may prevent future searches \\n            if character_designation not in indexes : \\n                return False \\n            # for index in range up to character designation \\n            for lesser_character in range(character_designation) : \\n                # if indexes at lesser character and indexes at lesser character lists 0th item is before indexes at character designations lists 0th item \\n                if indexes[lesser_character] and indexes[lesser_character][0] < indexes[character_designation][0] : \\n                    # our lists are not transformable, False \\n                    # this is because for any select string mapping of character designations that are greater than their sub indexes \\n                    # it must be such that the index priors sub mapping does not interfere with the index current mapping. \\n                    # this is detailed in the problem statement where they note that values must be in ascending order \\n                    return False \\n            # after consideration using this most recent index, remove it \\n            indexes[character_designation].popleft()\\n            # if length is now zero, remove it \\n            if len(indexes[character_designation]) == 0 : \\n                indexes.pop(character_designation)\\n        \\n        # if all characters able to sort, return it \\n        return True \\n```",
