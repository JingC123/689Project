        "content": "# Intuition\\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\\nAt the base of this problem is a linear scan. This is because we are trying to achieve the pairing of minimum number of moves and maximum number of moves. As such, we are trying to sort the move value space and scan over it linearly. This can be achieved with a few key insights from the problem that keep it at a medium level. \\n\\nFirst, we have a list size lower bound of 3. This is actually dreadfully important for one of our key edge cases that make this easily solvable so don\\'t discard such things when they come up! \\n\\nSecond, we have that all the stone values are unique. \\n\\nThird, we have that all the stone values are positive integers from 1 to 10^9. This is important both as an insight into the fact that we are working with only positive values, and that we are working with a very large value space compared to a much relatively smaller value ordination (there are 10^9 values for the stones, but only 10^4 positions at most for them) \\n\\nWe are also provided with a helpful hint \\n>For the minimum, how many cows are already in place? For the maximum, we have to lose either the gap A[1] - A[0] or A[N-1] - A[N-2] (where N = A.length), but every other space can be occupied ?  \\n\\nWe turn first to the idea of the maximum, where we have a gap we will need to lose of either between the first and second position or ultimate and penultimate position. \\n\\nIf we consider a list of 3 items, our minimum, what is our minimum values to get our minimal return? Not to spoil anything, but it is 1, 2, 3 \\n\\nThis is key to the problem, since there are no spaces provided between the values, so our return should be [0, 0] \\n\\nBy realizing the impact of this the approach follows below. Try to work out for a few values and sizes to get the feel for it and you\\'ll likely find an understanding either intuitively or by action. I recommend working with small list sizes and trying to generate [0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 2], and [2, 2] with only 3 or so items. It\\'ll be difficult, but worth it for the understanding pay off. \\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nThe original ordering of the stones is not valid compared to their ordinal positioning, and since we know we have a size limit much less than a value limit, we start by sorting. \\n\\nThen, we want to know how much space we have to work witin, so get the size of your listing (how many stones do you have regardless of how much they are worth?) \\n\\nThen, we need to calculate the two largest costs, move penultimate and move ultimate (final in the code) \\n\\nMove penultimate is the cost of swapping the stones at the second to last spot and the first spot, minus the cost of the number of stones you have (Since you moved over the whole thing!) plus 2 to deal with the fact that they are unique\\n\\nMove ultimate is the cost of swapping the stones at the last spot and second spot, minus the cost of the number of stones you have plus 2 to deal with the fact that they are unique\\n\\nIf either of these is 0, the other must be locked in as most moves, as most moves will be the max of these two options (try to convince yourself of why that is the case! This relates to the idea of the list sizings, and is really clearly seen with a list of size 3)\\n\\nIf either is 0, \\n- min legal moves is min of 2 and most moves \\n- return min legal moves and most moves \\n\\nOtherwise we now must consider how many max legal moves are there really? \\n\\nSet max legal moves to 0 \\nSet starting index to 0 \\nenumerate index and stone in stones \\n- while stones at starting index lte stone - stone length \\n    - increment starting index \\n- our max legal moves here is the max of itself (so it preserves good discoveries) and index - starting index + 1 (+1 for the fact we use 0 indexing) \\n- but, it cannot get too big! Remember, we already found the actual max, so don\\'t let anything in here fool you! Set max legal moves as such to min(max(max_legal_moves, index - starting_index + 1), max_moves) \\n- this keeps our newly found max legal less than our actual max moves \\n\\nWhen done enumerating return length - max legal moves, max moves \\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity : O(S log S + S)\\n    - O(S log S) to sort the stones \\n    - O(S) to loop over (while loop is incindental, as it can only run as many times as the length of stones as well in total, so it does not add to this)  \\n\\n- Space complexity : O(1)\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nNo additional space utilized \\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    \\'\\'\\'\\n        Test cases walk through \\n        Given 7, 4, 9 prove 1, 2                                                            6, 5, 4, 3, 10, prove 2, 3 \\n\\n        Sort stones -> 4, 7, 9                                                              3, 4, 5, 6, 10 \\n        Stone length -> 3                                                                   5\\n        Move penultimate = 7 - 4 - 3 + 2 = 2                                                6-3-5+2 = 0 \\n        Move final = 9 - 7 - 3 + 2 = 1                                                      10-4-5+2 = 3 \\n        Neither is 0, so we cannot return for sure                                          Move penultimate is 0, so move final is assured \\n                                                                                            This means we can return [min(2, 3), 3] -> [2, 3]\\n\\n        Max legal moves is 0                                                                For completeness, max legal moves is 0, max moves is 3  \\n        starting index is 0                                                                 starting index is 0 \\n\\n        Enumeration                                                                         Enumeration\\n            index is 0, stone is 4                                                             index is 0, stone is 3 \\n            stones[0] lte 4 - 3 ?
