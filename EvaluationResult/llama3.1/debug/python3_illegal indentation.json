        "content": "# Intuition\\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\\nAt the base of this problem is a linear scan. This is because we are trying to achieve the pairing of minimum number of moves and maximum number of moves. As such, we are trying to sort the move value space and scan over it linearly. This can be achieved with a few key insights from the problem that keep it at a medium level. \\n\\nFirst, we have a list size lower bound of 3. This is actually dreadfully important for one of our key edge cases that make this easily solvable so don\\'t discard such things when they come up! \\n\\nSecond, we have that all the stone values are unique. \\n\\nThird, we have that all the stone values are positive integers from 1 to 10^9. This is important both as an insight into the fact that we are working with only positive values, and that we are working with a very large value space compared to a much relatively smaller value ordination (there are 10^9 values for the stones, but only 10^4 positions at most for them) \\n\\nWe are also provided with a helpful hint \\n>For the minimum, how many cows are already in place? For the maximum, we have to lose either the gap A[1] - A[0] or A[N-1] - A[N-2] (where N = A.length), but every other space can be occupied ?  \\n\\nWe turn first to the idea of the maximum, where we have a gap we will need to lose of either between the first and second position or ultimate and penultimate position. \\n\\nIf we consider a list of 3 items, our minimum, what is our minimum values to get our minimal return? Not to spoil anything, but it is 1, 2, 3 \\n\\nThis is key to the problem, since there are no spaces provided between the values, so our return should be [0, 0] \\n\\nBy realizing the impact of this the approach follows below. Try to work out for a few values and sizes to get the feel for it and you\\'ll likely find an understanding either intuitively or by action. I recommend working with small list sizes and trying to generate [0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 2], and [2, 2] with only 3 or so items. It\\'ll be difficult, but worth it for the understanding pay off. \\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nThe original ordering of the stones is not valid compared to their ordinal positioning, and since we know we have a size limit much less than a value limit, we start by sorting. \\n\\nThen, we want to know how much space we have to work witin, so get the size of your listing (how many stones do you have regardless of how much they are worth?) \\n\\nThen, we need to calculate the two largest costs, move penultimate and move ultimate (final in the code) \\n\\nMove penultimate is the cost of swapping the stones at the second to last spot and the first spot, minus the cost of the number of stones you have (Since you moved over the whole thing!) plus 2 to deal with the fact that they are unique\\n\\nMove ultimate is the cost of swapping the stones at the last spot and second spot, minus the cost of the number of stones you have plus 2 to deal with the fact that they are unique\\n\\nIf either of these is 0, the other must be locked in as most moves, as most moves will be the max of these two options (try to convince yourself of why that is the case! This relates to the idea of the list sizings, and is really clearly seen with a list of size 3)\\n\\nIf either is 0, \\n- min legal moves is min of 2 and most moves \\n- return min legal moves and most moves \\n\\nOtherwise we now must consider how many max legal moves are there really? \\n\\nSet max legal moves to 0 \\nSet starting index to 0 \\nenumerate index and stone in stones \\n- while stones at starting index lte stone - stone length \\n    - increment starting index \\n- our max legal moves here is the max of itself (so it preserves good discoveries) and index - starting index + 1 (+1 for the fact we use 0 indexing) \\n- but, it cannot get too big! Remember, we already found the actual max, so don\\'t let anything in here fool you! Set max legal moves as such to min(max(max_legal_moves, index - starting_index + 1), max_moves) \\n- this keeps our newly found max legal less than our actual max moves \\n\\nWhen done enumerating return length - max legal moves, max moves \\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity : O(S log S + S)\\n    - O(S log S) to sort the stones \\n    - O(S) to loop over (while loop is incindental, as it can only run as many times as the length of stones as well in total, so it does not add to this)  \\n\\n- Space complexity : O(1)\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nNo additional space utilized \\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    \\'\\'\\'\\n        Test cases walk through \\n        Given 7, 4, 9 prove 1, 2                                                            6, 5, 4, 3, 10, prove 2, 3 \\n\\n        Sort stones -> 4, 7, 9                                                              3, 4, 5, 6, 10 \\n        Stone length -> 3                                                                   5\\n        Move penultimate = 7 - 4 - 3 + 2 = 2                                                6-3-5+2 = 0 \\n        Move final = 9 - 7 - 3 + 2 = 1                                                      10-4-5+2 = 3 \\n        Neither is 0, so we cannot return for sure                                          Move penultimate is 0, so move final is assured \\n                                                                                            This means we can return [min(2, 3), 3] -> [2, 3]\\n\\n        Max legal moves is 0                                                                For completeness, max legal moves is 0, max moves is 3  \\n        starting index is 0                                                                 starting index is 0 \\n\\n        Enumeration                                                                         Enumeration\\n            index is 0, stone is 4                                                             index is 0, stone is 3 \\n            stones[0] lte 4 - 3 ?

As such, we can consider this one with not too much of a stretch of the mind. \\n\\nEach integer value in our selected string has a list of indices at which it appears. IF we make a mapping of these list of indices for each value in order of appearance in s, we can use that against the ordering of appearance of list of values in t (we do not necessarily need to make said list of t, but could if we so chose) \\n\\nOnce we have this map, our first bet is to actually get the set of unique items in t, which can be done rather nicely with generators that will do the autoskip inclusions as needed. \\n\\nUsing unique t, our first check is that all of the unique t values are present. If not, then we can skip to returning False. \\n\\nOtherwise, we need to loop over t, and for each character check if it is in our map. If not, also False. \\n\\nIf we then loop over values up to this point (such that if we drew say 5 we\\'d go from 0 to 4 inclusive) we need to find that the value is in indexes and that the indexes at that point has a starting value at least as advanced or more so than the indexes for the drawn values first appearance. If this does not occur, then they are not in ascending order and may also return False. \\n\\nIf all of that passes, we need to discard the current item at the front of indexes at the drawn character. If in doing so we now eliminate that list, we need to eliminate the character drawn from indices entirely (this is why we have that second check for inclusion near the top). \\n\\nIf we manage all of that, there\\'s nothing to stop the transformation and can return True. \\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nUse collections default dict with collections deque for each character valuation in s \\n\\nMake a map of the character values -> list of indices of occurrence in order from first to last \\n\\nMake a set of unique t values \\n\\n- For each unique t value in unique t values \\n    - if that value is not in our mapping \\n        - return False \\n\\nLoop over t (effectively getting the unique indices for each value of t) \\n- as you do, convert your character into its designated key (This is here for other mapping versions of the problem) \\n- if we do not have that designated ky in our map \\n    - return false \\n- otherwise, loop over lesser character designations in range to character designation \\n    - if we have the map at lesser character designation and the map at lesser character designation points to a list whose first index of occurrence is less than the first index of occurrence of our current character designation, it must be that they are not in order, and can return False \\n- after completing lesser character loop, remove the most recent occurrence of indexes at character designation by popping left from the map at the character designation \\n- if the map now points to an empty list for character designation, remove character designation from the map entirely.    \\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity : O(S + T)\\n    - O(S) to build s mapping \\n    - O(T) to build t unique characters \\n    - O(T) to loop over characters in T \\n        - within which we do at most O(5) work to loop in range of lesser characters on average \\n    - Total then is O(S + T + ~5T) -> O(S + C * T) -> O(S + T)  \\n\\n\\n- Space complexity : O(S + t) \\n    - Store O(s) lists of size to account for S, so O(S) \\n    - Store O(t) \\n    - Remove storage for potentially all of O(S) \\n    - Averages out to O(S + t) at worst  \\n\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def isTransformable(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool :\\n        # make a mapping of deque lists called indexes \\n        indexes = collections.defaultdict(collections.deque)\\n        # enumerate s \\n        for index, character in enumerate(s) :\\n            # indexes at the int cast of character has this index added to it  \\n            indexes[int(character)].append(index)\\n\\n        # get unique values in t \\n        unique_t_values = set([int(t_i) for t_i in t])\\n        # for t_v in unique t values \\n        for t_v in unique_t_values : \\n            # if not in indexes \\n            if t_v not in indexes :\\n                # return False as we are missing pieces  \\n                return False \\n        \\n        # loop over t in order given  \\n        for character in t : \\n            # get the characters integer designation \\n            character_designation = int(character)\\n            # update may cause new misses which may prevent future searches \\n            if character_designation not in indexes : \\n                return False \\n            # for index in range up to character designation \\n            for lesser_character in range(character_designation) : \\n                # if indexes at lesser character and indexes at lesser character lists 0th item is before indexes at character designations lists 0th item \\n                if indexes[lesser_character] and indexes[lesser_character][0] < indexes[character_designation][0] : \\n                    # our lists are not transformable, False \\n                    # this is because for any select string mapping of character designations that are greater than their sub indexes \\n                    # it must be such that the index priors sub mapping does not interfere with the index current mapping. \\n                    # this is detailed in the problem statement where they note that values must be in ascending order \\n                    return False \\n            # after consideration using this most recent index, remove it \\n            indexes[character_designation].popleft()\\n            # if length is now zero, remove it \\n            if len(indexes[character_designation]) == 0 : \\n                indexes.pop(character_designation)\\n        \\n        # if all characters able to sort, return it \\n        return True \\n```",
